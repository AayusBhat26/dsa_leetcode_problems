# **Problem: Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid**

**Problem Statement:** You are given a parentheses string `s` and a binary string `locked`, both of length `n`. The `locked` string tells you whether you can change the corresponding character in `s`:

- If `locked[i] == '1'`, the character at index `i` in `s` is fixed.
- If `locked[i] == '0'`, you can change the character at index `i` in `s` to either `(` or `)`.

Your task is to determine if it's possible to change some characters in `s` (where `locked[i] == '0'`) such that the string becomes a valid parentheses string.

### **Approach:**

There are two primary methods to solve this problem:

### **1. Using Two Counters (Efficient Solution)**

The idea is to perform two passes through the string:

1. **Left-to-right pass**: Count how many open parentheses (`(`) and close parentheses (`)`) are encountered, ensuring the string doesn't become invalid at any point.
2. **Right-to-left pass**: Ensure that after the first pass, the parentheses can be balanced from the other direction as well.

**Steps:**

1. Traverse the string from left to right:
    
    - If `s[i]` is `(` or `locked[i] == '0'` (indicating we can make it a `(`), increment the count of open parentheses.
    - If `s[i]` is `)` and `locked[i] == '1'`, decrement the count of open parentheses.
    - If at any point the count of open parentheses goes negative, it means the parentheses are imbalanced, and we return `false`.
2. Traverse the string from right to left:
    
    - Similar to the left-to-right pass, check if it's possible to balance the parentheses in reverse order.
3. Return `true` if both passes are successful, otherwise return `false`.

### **Code:**

Copy code

`class Solution { public:     bool canBeValid(string s, string locked) {         int n = s.length();         if (n % 2 != 0) {             return false;  // If the length is odd, it can't be valid         }          // Left to right pass: ensure balanced open parentheses         int countOpen = 0;         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {             if (s[i] == '(' || locked[i] == '0') {                 countOpen++;  // Can make it an opening parenthesis             } else {                 countOpen--;  // It's a closing parenthesis             }             if (countOpen < 0) return false;  // Too many closing parentheses         }          // Right to left pass: ensure balanced closing parentheses         int countClose = 0;         for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {             if (s[i] == ')' || locked[i] == '0') {                 countClose++;  // Can make it a closing parenthesis             } else {                 countClose--;  // It's an opening parenthesis             }             if (countClose < 0) return false;  // Too many opening parentheses         }          return true;  // Valid if both passes succeed     } };`

### **Time Complexity:**

- **O(n)**: We traverse the string twice, making this approach linear in time.

### **Space Complexity:**

- **O(1)**: Only a few variables are used, making the space complexity constant.
