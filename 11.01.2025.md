# Problem Name: word subsets

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.  
A string `b` is a subset of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.  
A string `a` from `words1` is **universal** if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the **universal strings** in `words1`.

### **Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lc","eo"]
Output: ["leetcode"]
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["acaac","cccbb","aacbb","caacc","bcbbb"], words2 = ["c","cc","b"]
Output: ["cccbb"]
```

### **Approach: Using Frequency Count (Optimized)**

**Key Idea:**

- To determine if a word is **universal**, it must satisfy the condition of being a **superstring** for all strings in `words2`.
- Convert the problem into **frequency counting**.

### **Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Maximum Requirement for words2:**
    - Compute the **maximum frequency** of each character across all words in `words2`.
2. **Check each word in words1:**
    - Count the frequency of characters for each word in `words1`.
    - Compare with the **maximum required frequency** from `words2`.

### **C++ Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to check if word1 can cover the requirements
    bool isSubSet(vector<int>& charRequired, vector<int>& temp) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (temp[i] < charRequired[i]) 
                return false; 
        }
        return true;
    }

    vector<string> wordSubsets(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
        vector<string> res;
        vector<int> charRequired(26, 0);  // Store the maximum frequency needed for each character

        // Step 1: Calculate the maximum frequency requirement across words2
        for (string& word : words2) {
            vector<int> temp(26, 0);
            for (char ch : word) {
                temp[ch - 'a']++;
                charRequired[ch - 'a'] = max(charRequired[ch - 'a'], temp[ch - 'a']);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Check each word in words1 against the required frequency
        for (string& word : words1) {
            vector<int> temp(26, 0);
            for (char ch : word) {
                temp[ch - 'a']++;
            }
            if (isSubSet(charRequired, temp)) {
                res.push_back(word);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Input:**
    - `words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]`
    - `words2 = ["e", "o"]`
2. **Step 1:** Calculate the maximum frequency requirement from `words2`.
    - `e -> 1`, `o -> 1` â†’ `charRequired = [0,0,0,...1,0,...1,...0]`
3. **Step 2:** Check each word in `words1`.
    - `"facebook"` has both `"e"` and `"o"` â†’ valid.
    - `"amazon"` â†’ doesn't satisfy `"o"` requirement.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:**
    
    - `O(n * l + m * k)`
    - `n` = number of words in `words1`.
    - `l` = average length of words in `words1`.
    - `m` = number of words in `words2`.
    - `k` = average length of words in `words2`.
- **Space Complexity:**
    
    - `O(26)` for storing the frequency count (constant space).

---

### âœ… **Edge Cases Handled:**

- If `words1` or `words2` is empty.
- If all words in `words1` are subsets of `words2`.

---

### **Test Cases:**

```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["a","b","c"], words2 = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]

Input: words1 = ["abc","def","ghi"], words2 = ["z"]
Output: []
```

---

### **Summary:**

- Use a **frequency count** approach for efficiency.
- Count the **maximum required frequency** for each character in `words2`.
- Validate each word in `words1` using the **subset** condition.
